<h1>setjmp()/longjmp()</h1>

<b>Setjmp()</b> and <b>longjmp()</b> are subroutines that let you 
perform complex flow-of-control in C/Unix.  

<p>One of the keys to understanding <b>setjmp()</b> and
<b>longjmp()</b> is to understand machine layout, as
described in the assembler and <b>malloc</b> lectures 
of the past few weeks.
The state of a program depends completely on the
contents of its memory (i.e.  the code, globals,
heap, and stack), and the contents of its
registers.  The contents of the registers
includes the stack pointer (<b>sp</b>), frame pointer
(<b>fp</b>), and program counter (<b>pc</b>).  What <b>setjmp()</b> does
is save the contents of the registers so that
<b>longjmp()</b> can restore them later.  In this way, <b>longjmp()</b>
``returns'' to the state of the program when <b>setjmp()</b>
was called.  

</p><p>Specifically:

</p><pre>#include &lt; setjmp.h &gt;
int setjmp(jmp_buf env);
</pre>

This says to save the current state of the
registers into <b>env</b>.  If you look in
<a href="file:///usr/include/setjmp.h"><b>/usr/include/setjmp.h</b></a>,
you'll see that
<b>jmp_buf</b> is defined as: 

<pre>#define _JBLEN  9
typedef struct { int _jb[_JBLEN + 1]; } jmp_buf[1];
</pre>
This is an irritating way of saying that <b>jmp_buf</b> is an 
array of <b>_JBLEN+1</b> integers.

<p>So, when you call <b>setjmp()</b>, you pass it the address
of an array of integers, and it stores the value of the
registers in that array.  <b>Setjmp()</b> returns 0 when
you call it in this way.  

</p><pre>longjmp(jmp_buf env, int val);
</pre>

<b>Longjmp()</b> resets the registers to
the values saved in <b>env</b>.  <i>This includes the <b>sp</b>,
<b>fp</b> and <b>pc</b></i>.  What this means is that <b>longjmp()</b>
doesn't return.   Instead, when you call it, you
return as if you have just called the <b>setjmp()</b> call
that saved <b>env</b>.  This is because the <b>pc</b> is
restored along with the other registers.
<b>Setjmp()</b> returns the <b>val</b> argument of <b>longjmp()</b>,
which is not allowed to be zero (read the man
page).  Thus, you know when <b>setjmp()</b> returns a
non-zero value that <b>longjmp()</b> was called, and is
returning to <b>setjmp()</b>.  

<p>As an example, look at the following code (in 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~huangj/cs360/360/notes/Setjmp/sj1.c"><b>sj1.c</b></a>):

</p><hr>
<pre>#include &lt; setjmp.h &gt;

main()
{
  jmp_buf env;
  int i;

  i = setjmp(env);
  printf("i = %d\n", i);

  if (i != 0) exit(0);

  longjmp(env, 2);
  printf("Does this line get printed?\n");

}
</pre>
<hr>

When we run this, we get:

<pre>UNIX&gt; sj1
i = 0
i = 2
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

So, first, we call <b>setjmp()</b>, and it returns 0.
Then we call <b>longjmp()</b> with a value of 2, which
causes the code to return from <b>setjmp()</b> with a
value of 2.  That value is printed out, and the
code exits. 

<p><b>Setjmp()</b> and <b>longjmp()</b> are usually used so that
if an error is detected within a long string of
procedure calls, the error may be dealt with
gracefully by a high-level call.  For example,
look at 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~huangj/cs360/360/notes/Setjmp/sj2.c"><b>sj2.c</b></a>.
It looks to be complicated, but
really isn't.  What happens is that there is a
complicated series of procedure calls -- <b>proc_1</b>
through <b>proc_4</b>.  If <b>proc_4</b>'s argument is zero,
then it flags the error by calling <b>longjmp()</b>.
Otherwise, things proceed normally.  As you can
see, if you call <b>sj2</b> with all positive arguments,
then everything is ok.  However, if you call it
with all zeros, it will make the <b>longjmp()</b> call,
and flag an error: 

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; sj2 1 2 3 4
proc_1(1, 2, 3, 4) = 4
UNIX&gt; sj2 0 0 0 0
Error -- bad value of i (0), j (0), k (0), l (0)
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

<hr>
Now, <b>setjmp()</b> saves all the registers, including the <b>sp</b>
and <b>fp</b>.
What this means is that if you return from a procedure that 
calls <b>setjmp()</b>, then the <b>env</b> buffer of that
<b>setjmp()</b> will no longer be valid.  Why?  Because
that <b>env</b> buffer contains the <b>sp</b> and <b>fp</b> of the
calling procedure.  If that procedure returns,
then when you restore the <b>sp</b> and <b>fp</b>, the stack
will be in a different state than before, and you
will have an error.  For example, look at 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~huangj/cs360/360/notes/Setjmp/sj3.c"><b>sj3.c</b></a>.

<p>When we execute it, we get the following:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; sj3
Setjmp() returned -- i = 0
s = Jim
In B: i=3.  Calling longjmp(env, i)
Setjmp() returned -- i = 3
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

So, exactly what is happening?  When the <b>main()</b> routine is first called,
the stack looks as follows:

<pre>              Stack        
        |----------------|
        |                |
        |                |
        |                |
        |                |
        |                |
        |                | &lt;-------- sp
        | env[0]         |
        | env[1]         |
        | env[2]         |               pc = main
        | env[3]         |
        | ....           |
        | env[8]         |
        | other stuff    | &lt;------- fp
        |--------------- |
</pre>

Now, <b>main()</b> calls <b>a()</b>.  First it pushes the
arguments on the stack in reverse order, and then
<b>jsr</b> is called, which pushes the return <b>pc</b> on the
stack, and the old <b>fp</b>.  The <b>fp</b> and <b>sp</b> are changed
to make an empty stack frame for <b>a()</b>: 

<pre>                                     Stack        
                               |----------------|
                               |                |
                               |                | &lt;--------- sp, fp
                /------------- | old fp in main |
                |              | old pc in main |
                |   "Jim" &lt;--- | s = "Jim"      |
                |         /--- | pointer to env | 
                |         \--&gt; | env[0]         |
                |              | env[1]         |
                |              | env[2]         |               pc = a
                |              | env[3]         |
                |              | ....           |
                |              | env[8]         |
                \------------&gt; | other stuff    | 
                               |--------------- |
</pre>
                    
<p>The first thing that a() does is allocate room its local variable i:
                    
</p><pre>                                     Stack        
                               |----------------|
                               |                | &lt;--------- sp
                               |      i         | &lt;--------- fp
                /------------- | old fp in main |
                |              | old pc in main |
                |   "Jim" &lt;--- | s = "Jim"      |
                |         /--- | pointer to env | 
                |         \--&gt; | env[0]         |
                |              | env[1]         |
                |              | env[2]         |               pc = a
                |              | env[3]         |
                |              | ....           |
                |              | env[8]         |
                \------------&gt; | other stuff    | 
                               |--------------- |
</pre>
                    
Then it calls <b>setjmp()</b>.  This saves the current state of the registers.
In other words, it saves the current values of
<b>sp</b>, <b>fp</b>, and <b>pc</b>.  Now, <b>a()</b> prints "<b>i = 0</b>", 
and "<b>s = Jim</b>", and then returns to <b>main()</b>.  Now the stack
looks as before, except that <b>env</b> is initialized
to the state of the machine when <b>a()</b> was called: 

<pre>                                     Stack        
                               |----------------|
                               |                |
                               |                | 
                               |                |
                               |                |
                               |                |
                               |                | &lt;----------- sp
                               | env[0]         |
                               | env[1]         |
                               | env[2]         |               pc = main
                               | env[3]         |
                               | ....           |
                               | env[8]         |
                               | other stuff    | &lt;------------ fp
                               |--------------- |
</pre>

Now, <b>main()</b> calls <b>b()</b>, and the stack looks as follows:

<pre>                                     Stack        
                               |----------------|
                               |                |
                               |                | &lt;--------- sp, fp
                /------------- | old fp in main |
                |              | old pc in main |
                |              | i = 3          |
                |         /--- | pointer to env | 
                |         \--&gt; | env[0]         |
                |              | env[1]         |
                |              | env[2]         |               pc = b
                |              | env[3]         |
                |              | ....           |
                |              | env[8]         |
                \------------&gt; | other stuff    | 
                               |--------------- |
</pre>

Then <b>longjmp()</b> is called.  The registers
are restored to their values when <b>a()</b> called
<b>setjmp()</b>, and the <b>pc</b> returns from <b>setjmp()</b> in <b>a()</b>.
However, the values in the stack are the same as
they were for <b>b()</b>: 

<pre>                                     Stack        
                               |----------------|
                               |                | &lt;--------- sp
                               | i = 2          | &lt;--------- fp
                /------------- | old fp in main |
                |              | old pc in main |
                |              | s??    = 3     |
                |         /--- | pointer to env | 
                |         \--&gt; | env[0]         |
                |              | env[1]         |
                |              | env[2]         |               pc = a
                |              | env[3]         |
                |              | ....           |
                |              | env[8]         |
                \------------&gt; | other stuff    | 
                               |--------------- |
</pre>


You should see the problem.  The stack is in a bad state.  In particular, 
<b>a()</b> expects there to be a <b>(char *)</b> where <b>s</b> is,
and instead, there is the integer value 3.  Thus,
when it tries to print out <b>s</b>, it tries to find a 
string at memory location 3, and dumps core.  

<p>This is a very common bug with <b>setjmp()</b> and
<b>longjmp()</b> -- to use them properly, you <i>CANNOT
RETURN FROM THE PROCEDURE THAT CALLS <b>setjmp()</b></i>.  As
you can see, this bug is subtle -- the stack
frame for <b>b()</b> looks a lot like the stack frame
for <b>a()</b>, and thus this bug might slip by
unnoticed for a while.

<h1>Setjmp() and signals</h1>

One of the nice things about <b>setjmp()</b> and <b>longjmp()</b> is
that you can <b>longjmp()</b> out of a signal handler, and
back into your program.  This lets you catch
those signals again. 

<p>Look at <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~huangj/cs360/360/notes/Setjmp/sh4.c"><b>sh4.c</b></a>:

</p><p>Note that this program <b>longjmps</b> out of
<b>alarm_handler</b> after 8 seconds have passed, and
then prints "<b>Gave up</b>".  Be sure you can trace
through this.  

</p><hr>
<h1>png.c</h1>

Ok -- in the program <p>Look at <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~huangj/cs360/360/notes/Setjmp/png.c"><b>png.c</b></a> (which
stands for "prime number generator"), there is some really cool stuff
going on.  Copy it and run it (you'll have to exit with
<b>CNTL-C</b>), and then see if you can figure out what's going on.
Note that this program may seg-fault.  Can you figure out why?
Unfortunately, I will not have time to go over this program, but it
is a good exercise to see if you can understand it.  
</p><p>
Obviously, you'd do better to use threads to implement something like
this.
